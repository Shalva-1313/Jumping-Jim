# Project 3 â€“ Graph Modeling and Graph Algorithms  
**COT 4400, Spring 2025**  
**Due:** May 7, 2025  

## Overview  
This project solves the **"Jumping Jim"** maze problem by modeling it as a **graph** and applying a **graph search algorithm** to determine a valid path from the starting square (top-left) to the goal square (bottom-right).  

In the maze, each square contains an integer that indicates the exact number of spaces Jim must move **horizontally** or **vertically** (not diagonally) when bouncing off that trampoline. The challenge is to determine a sequence of moves that leads to the goal.  

---

## Problem Summary  
- **Vertices:** Each square in the maze.  
- **Edges:** Possible moves from a square, determined by the integer value in that square (jump distance).  
- **Goal:** Reach the bottom-right square.  
- **Allowed Moves:** N (north), E (east), S (south), W (west).  

Example start:  
- From `(0,0)` with value `3`, you could move three spaces down or three spaces right.  

---

## Input Format  
The program reads **`input.txt`** with the following format:  


Where:  
- `r` = number of rows in the maze  
- `c` = number of columns in the maze  
- Each `aij` = number of spaces Jim will move from that square  

---

## Output Format  
The program writes to **`output.txt`** a **single line** containing the sequence of moves (N, E, S, W) separated by spaces.  
Example:  
Means:  
1. Move 3 spaces right  
2. Move 3 spaces down  
3. Move 2 spaces right
